        <h2>Decorating with plants is simple</h2>
        <p>To create the most interesting display, use a mixture of plant sizes
            and leaf shapes. A large plant like Pippa the peace lily, mixed with
            something sculptural like Susie the snake plant and a soft fern like
            Bertie gives an attractive range of textures. Hanging plants, like
            Rapunzel the golden pothos, add interest at different heights. Donâ€™t
            forget your pots. Matching pots will look clean and elegant, while a
            mix of styles and patterns looks eclectic and fun.</p>
